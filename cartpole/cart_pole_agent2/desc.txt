Reward:
- 0 for every step
- -1 for cart position greater than +-1, cart velocity greater than 50%, pole angle greater than 8 degress and pole angular velocity is more than 65%
- 1 for pole angle within 4 degrees, angular velocity within 15%, cart position within 1 and cart velocity is within 50%

Changes from last training: Added Target network to Deep Q Learning

Training:
- Algorithm: DeepQLearning
- Episodes: 3900
- Batch Size: 16
- Replay Size: 1000
- Exploration Decay: 1.1
- Min Exploration: 0.1
- Exploration Decay After: 100
- Discount Factor: 0.9
- Update Target Network Parameters After: 100 steps
- Optimizer: RMSProp

Results:
Training satisfactory. Agent is able to keep the pole upwright, balanced, and the angular velocity in control with
very little actions on the cart. It is even able to recover from a fairly disbalanced state
