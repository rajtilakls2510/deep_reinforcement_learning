Reward:
- 0 for every step
- -1 for cart position greater than +-1, cart velocity greater than 50%, pole angle greater than 8 degress and pole angular velocity is more than 65%
- 1 for pole angle within 4 degrees, angular velocity within 15%, cart position within 1 and cart velocity is within 50%

Results:
Training satisfactory. Agent is able to keep the pole upwright, balanced, and the angular velocity in control with
very little actions on the cart.
